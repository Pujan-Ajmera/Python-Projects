(I dont know if instagram has unlike all liked reels feature in their app , probably not so) Until recently, Instagram prioritized privacy when it came to the posts you liked. Now, features like showing your liked posts and reels to your followers make this activity more public. 
While we can’t change this policy, I wanted a way to manage my own likes.
I’ve created a Python automation that allows you to unlike all your posts and reels. 
For accounts with many liked reels, it may take some time to process everything, but once you run the script, all likes will be cleared efficiently. just a few steps to follow in the start when you run the script and 
boom all your reels are unliked
