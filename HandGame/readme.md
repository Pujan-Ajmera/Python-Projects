🎮 **Interactive Hand-Tracking Game** 🚀

Excited to share a fun project that combines hand-tracking and interactive gaming! ✋👾

Using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, I created a game where you control the action with your **index finger**. The objective? Touch the randomly moving circles on the screen to score points. 🏆✨

Key Features:
- 🖐️ Real-time **hand detection** and **tracking**.
- 🎨 Randomly moving **colorful circles**.
- ⏳ **20-second timer** for extra challenge.
- 🏅 **Score points** by touching the circles with your finger.
- 🌟 **Max score feature** to track the highest score achieved!

It’s a great example of blending **computer vision** and **interactive fun**! 🎮
